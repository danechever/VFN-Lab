function VFN_FMTO_setAutoGain(FMTO, readVal)
% VFN_FMTO_setAutoGain Function for automatically setting the gain:
%   Takes in a power reading and changes the gain accordingly to ensure
%   that future reads are within reasonable bounds on the Femto PM. If 
%   the reading is already within bounds, nothing is done.
%
%   - Assumes the gain setting is set to "high-speed" on the Femto
%
%   - The code shoots to intelligently place the new reading within bounds:
%       If readVal < modBoundLow, the gain will be increased until 
%         newVal > 1  
%       If readVal > modBoundHigh, the gain will be decreased until 
%         newVal < 1
%   
%       Current Mod Bounds:     [0.1 V < readVal < 9.5 V]
%
%   EXAMPLE:______
%   VFN_FMTO_setAutoGain(FMTO, readVal)
%       FMTO:   a struct representing the Femto object and pertinent params     
%       readVal:A recent reading to use as a starting point

modBoundLow     = 0.1; % Volts
modBoundHigh    = 9.5; % Volts
