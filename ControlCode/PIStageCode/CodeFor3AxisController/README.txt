This is code written by the ET Lab for running the 3-axis E-873 controllers
As such, if you connect a 1-axis controller, it will work but you'll only have one axis
*NOTE: the HCST_Lib repo may have better code for running the 3-axis controllers
There is newer code for running 3 1-axis controllers in parallel
I just kept this code for reference
