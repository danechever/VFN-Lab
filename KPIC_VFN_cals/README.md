# KPIC_VFN_cals #
### Code used for doing calibrations for the KPIC VFN mode

This code is a copy of the version that exists on nfiuserver. Due
to issues with SVN vs. git access on the nfiuserver, we can't readily
use the kpic_server repo so we have copied the relevant KPIC VFN cals 
code to this directory. Syncing to/from the nfiserver needs to be done
manually, this is just here as a convenience so that we can track 
mods to the code and so that users without access to nfiuserver can
work with the code.
